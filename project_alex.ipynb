I would assume that the more people who die because of this disease, the more one would want to get vaccinated for it (or governments pushing for vaccinations).  Another interesting feature of this graph is that the human-development-index is quite correlated with the Covid reproduction rate, as in the higher the index the higher the reproduction rate.  I can't think why that would be; I would think it would be the other way around. Also, the stringency index is correlated with new cases, new deaths,and new people vaccinated smoothed which seems likely but it is also correlated with the human development index.  And, it is not correlated with reproduction rate.  If it had been correlated with reproduction rate, I would think it would have been negatively correlated."

    "We wanted a model that could determine what features would  contribute to decreased / increased Covid cases and decreased / increased Covid deaths.  We needed a method that could predict Covid outcomes.  We did achieve our goals with an kNN model of new-deaths with an accuracy of 0.689.  For our new-cases predictor, our random forest regressor model had a RMSE of 227.91.  However the important attributes for the models were mostly population, again the other features were dwarfed by the large imput of population data.  \n",

    "The models created for this analysis use different prediction methods to determine the range of new cases and the number of new deaths resulting from Covid-19. While many of these models may have already been created, there is still a lot unknown about Covid-19. So, companies and organizations are eager to obtain any data and information they can get on Covid-19. If companies have a lot of data, they may want to study different models and outcomes, potentially making our models appealing to different organizations. Companies and organizations such as the CDC, Baylor Scott and White, and other participants in the health industry may be interested in these types of models. They may even improve accuracy of the models by incorporating and adding their own data. \n",

    "The dataset used for this analysis was partially obtained from The Covid-19 Data Repository, which is for the Coronavirus Visual Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, and many other official sources. Since the pandemic's beginning, many people and groups within the health sector have been contributing and building datasets to study Covid-19. Like these groups, our model could also be deployed to GitHub, and we could allow the public to download, execute, and improve our models. To specifically deploy our models to interested parties, we could collaborate with non-profit public health organizations that collaborate with hospitals, primary care facilities, and other health establishments.

    " ### How often would the model need to be updated, etc.? <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Every day, new data is being created, particularly for Covid-19. As a result, predictive models need to be updated. As we learn more about Covid-19, many new variables may become relevant. While predictive models are capable of handling a lot of new data, too much buildup of new data may cause the models to lose their effectiveness over time. After a month, quarter, or year, updating predictive models with new data is probably necessary. In order to determine how often a model should be updated, one has to consider how often the data is changing and how often decisions are being made off the model. If data is changing very rapidly or decisions are being made often, frequent updates may be best. When updating the model, you should be sure to investigate the new data, adjust the model, and reevaluate any assumptions made in the creation process.     "
